# Vertex-Group-Hierarchy-Sorter
List vertex groups in armature hierarchy order. (Takes your existing Vertex Groups and shows them in a much nicer way. This makes it easier for you to navigate)

‎  
# Requirement
You MUST have an Armature linked to your Mesh Object for this to work; otherwise, it won't know where to get the hierarchy tree from.
